# DriverPass-Journal

## What is DriverPass, and what do they want?
DriverPass is a company that identified a gap in the market: many people fail their first DMV driving test. To address this, DriverPass sought to create a system tailored to assist users in successfully passing their tests. They wanted a system designed with specific roles in mind, including Admin, Secretary, and User. The system needed to enable users to access various types of content, schedule and manage appointments, purchase packages, track their time, and remain in compliance with the latest DMV regulations.

## What diagram would you revise if you had to?
If I had to choose one aspect to revise, it would be the UML use case diagram. I recognize that it could have been more comprehensive by including additional actors and focusing on more detailed processes instead of simplifying them into functions. By refining this diagram, I could ensure it serves as a good foundation for development rather than shifting complexity to the implementation phase.

## How did you consider user needs?
There were multiple ways I interpreted user needs, I first had meetings, transcribed those meetings, took notes of what specifically the customer wanted and looked at blueprints that they have made for UI/layout. But even if they didn't go that far, it is important to make sure that your design is in-line with what the user expects. By consulting the end-users, shareholders, et cetera, I can ensure that everyone is happy with the end product, which is the point of these systems. 

## Design Philosophy
My approach to software design is tailored to the complexity of the system. For smaller, simpler programs, I rely on mental mapping and intuitive control of program flow. However, for larger, more intricate systems, I use diagramming to increase my understanding of the system. This includes visualizing workflows, mapping relationships between entities or objects, and establishing clear criteria and goals for the system. Looking ahead, I aim to create more cohesive and comprehensive diagrams that adhere to industry standards. My focus will be on ensuring these diagrams are both reader-friendly for stakeholders and programmer-friendly, providing clear, actionable diagrams to guide development effectively.
